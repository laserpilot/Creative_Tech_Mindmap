# Creative Tech Taxonomy - archive files

These were the original manually files used to make the initial diagram. They have now been deprecated, but are left in the repo for reference for now and may be removed later on.


These documents were converted to a D3-friendly format using the python script `process_data.py` and output to `processed_data.json` however, now that the format has been crystallized to a more appropriate format, these are left here as legacy elements.

the file `update_json_fields.py` is a cobbled together bit of code for adding or modifying the JSON field structure in bulk. it was originall made to adjust the format to add fields like description and tags, however, its use now would delete a lot of changes
