# Creative Tech Taxonomy
 An open taxonomy of software, hardware, and concepts related to creative technology and creative coding. Many relationships and hierarchies between topics are completely subjective and have many flaws, so please don't take these too seriously - if you have a correction or suggestion, please submit a pull request. This is a labor of love and not meant to be too prescriptive, just illustrative.

 This was created because taxonomies for this undefined space are important tools for developing a common language and grammar to better enable communication and education. 

 Originally created as a visual map [here](https://twitter.com/laserpilot/status/1104056855528128513/photo/1). 
 
 I later adapted this idea to a JSON structure for easy modification and portability to other environments. 

 This is currently in an early state, so please submit suggestions for data formats, or feel free to jump in and help with the rote work of filling in things like links/information/tags/etc.
